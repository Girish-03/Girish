I am Girish and currently pursuing MSc Data Science with AI at University of Exeter, UK. I am a data enthusiast and below is a list of some projects I undertook.

## Project 1: Deep Semantic Manipulation of Facial Videos
[![arXiv Preprint](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-Preprint-red?logo=arxiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07902)
  * Created and processed data for 3 different subjects using videos from YouTube and self-shot videos.
  * Developed a **novel capability** of generating and visualising expressions on 3D faces, using deep learning, by creating a robust mapping between valence-arousal space of human emotions and expression parameters of a 3D face model.
  * Rendered components of a 3D face to generate facial videos with highest level of realism.
  * Used this novel functionality of generating expressions to modify real facial expressions in a video.
  * Developed a user friendly and intuitive GUI to enable this facial video editing.
  * Undertook a wide set of experiments and user studies to validate the results.
  * **This work is to be submitted for the 29th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (IEEE ICIP- 2022).**

## Project 2: Expression Detection and visualization
<a href="https://github.com/Girish-03/expression_emonet"><img src="GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue.svg" width="200" height="25" /></a>

  * Performed facial landmark detection on each frame of the video.
  * Cropped face image using these landmarks.
  * Detected continuous Valence-Arousal values and discrete emotion labels for each frame.
  * Annotated video generation to visualise the discrete emotion labels as well as continuous VA values.
  * Checkout the project code and detailed description on Github.

## Project 3: Malaria Cells Classification
<a href="https://github.com/Girish-03/Malaria-Cells-Classification"><img src="GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue.svg" width="200" height="25" /></a>
  * This project uses the Machine Learning algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors and implements a deep learning- Convolutional Neural Network with tensorflow using       keras API.
  * Classifies cell images as infected or not infected.
  * The images were labelled as class 0 and 1 signifying uninfected and infected, followed by resizing, shuffling and visualisation.
  * Trained and tuned hyperparameters of a KNN classifier using n-fold cross validation.
  * Trained and tuned hyperparameters of a Convolutional Neural Network and experimented with different components.
  * Performed evaluations on both algorithms, achieving 60% accuracy with KNN and 96% accuracy with CNN on test dataset.
  * Checkout the project code and detailed description on Github

## Project 4: Knapsack Problem using Evolutionary Algorithm 
<a href="https://github.com/Girish-03/Knapsack-Probelm"><img src="GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue.svg" width="200" height="25" /></a>
  * Developed and used Evolutionary Algorithm to optimize and study The Knapsack Problem.
  * Followed EA regime of Selection, Crossover, Mutation and replacement of weekest in population.
  * Performed a series of experiments and evaluations using different components of EAs like mutation, crossover, population size and tournament selection.
  * Checkout the project code and detailed description on Github

## Project 5: Tweets-Analysis, March 2020 - Europe
<a href="https://github.com/Girish-03/Tweets-Analysis"><img src="GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue.svg" width="200" height="25" /></a>
  * Explored a large dataset of tweets collected from the twitter API during the period March 1st to March 31st 2020
  * Sampled and worked with around 100 GB data
  * Performed some Basic Stats, analyses and Data lookup
  * Created Interactive clustered Maps from geo-tagged tweets with functionality to read tweets by clicking on map markers
  * Analysed users and automated accounts
  * Identified unusual days and events in UK and Ireland
  * Checkout the project code and detailed description on Github

## Project 6: ECMM447: Networks-Analysis 
<a href="https://github.com/Girish-03/ECMM447-Networks-Analysis"><img src="GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue.svg" width="200" height="25" /></a>
  * Coursework under ECMM447 - Social Networks and Text Analysis at University
  * This coursework utilises the dataset from Enron communication network
  * Performed Network Analysis - Adjacency Matrix, Degree Distribution, Hypothesis Testing - Lognormal Distribution, Assortativity and Disassortativity.
  * Performed Community Detection and checked network centrality.
  * Performed Compartmental Modelling and simulation of Disease Spread using SI and SIR models
  * Checkout the project code and detailed description on Github
